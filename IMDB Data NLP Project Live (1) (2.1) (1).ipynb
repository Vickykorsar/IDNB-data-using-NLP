       "'This film was made as WWII was ending. The main interest in it was the exciting aerial photography used in it. For a propaganda film, \"God Is My Co-Pilot\" presents one aspect of the conflict in the Far East. It\\'s a story about bravery and courage as the young pilots of The Flying Tigers fought the conflict.<br /><br />The story of a war hero, Colonel Robert Scott, is at the center of the film. Col. Scott knew no fear as he took to the air. His comrades, the other pilots of the squadron, admired him deeply as he set a clear example about how to serve his country unselfishly. The air combats shown in the film must have been amazing to the audiences of the time in which the movie was released.<br /><br />Robert Flarey directed a film that made those young aces heroes in what would become the powerful might of the Air Force in future conflicts. Dennis Morgan was perfect as Col. Scott, the man who knew no fear. Raymond Massey plays General Chennault. Alan Hale appears as the friendly priest Big Mike. Some other familiar faces in the cast, Dane Clark, Mark Stevens, Craig Stevens, and other.<br /><br />The only thing with the print recently shown by TCM looks as though the film was re-dubbed as the dialog doesn\\'t match the lip movements of the actors in the film.'"
